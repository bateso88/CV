## About me 

I am junior developer focussing on the back-end who has recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech). I found the three months there challenging, exciting and immensely rewarding. I am now looking for a role that allows me to further expand my learning through complex problem-solving and continued exposure to new technologies. 

Previously I worked in insurance, in the Lloyd's of London market for 4 years. Automation was an essential skill I taught myself in order to improve accuracies in large amounts of data and save time otherwise spent on needless manual tasks. The satisfaction of seeing the vast improvements that my influence had on my team's work led me to consider a career change. 

I investigated the growing Insurtech industry and attended several conferences and lectures. I came to the conclusion that I would like to be a part of the tech industry to help modernise and improve other industries. Makers Academy has now really cemented in my mind the fact that I have made the right decision.

I am fast-learning, personable, mathematically-talented and have an eye for detail. I'm now eager to start coding professionally!

<!-- After graduating from Bristol University with a degree in Engineering Mathematics, I spent four years working in insurance as an underwriter in the Lloyd's of London market. The marketplace is well-known for its antiquated technologies and it was there that I really learned of the importance of good tech.

For the first 3 months of 2021 I was a student at Makers Academy. Here I became fully certain that I'd made the right decision to change career.

## Skills


#### Attention to Detail

In my time in insurance, consolidating large amounts of data came naturally. I would check the accuracy of thousands of payments and proof-read vast spreadsheets. One of my proudest moments was when I identified a £700,000 shortfall that various managers had previously missed, saving the company that amount. 

This skill is one that I have found extremely useful in learning to code, particularly in rapidly debugging issues.  

#### Self-led Learner

With no real experience in DIY, I taught myself how to convert a [van](https://www.instagram.com/tunathevan/) into a comfortable 'tiny home' with solar-powered electical, heating and water systems, in just 2 months. 

For my previous job I took the initiative to learn how to create complex, dynamic spreadsheets that connected to the company's database and updated automatically. This saved huge amounts of time otherwise spent on manually preparing reports, as it had been done for years beforehand. 

During my time at Makers this skill enabled me to learn new concepts, frameworks and languages quickly and produce high-quality code shortly thereafter.
 
<!-- During my time at makers I was able to learn new concepts, frameworks and languages quickly and produce high-quality code shortly thereafter. I produced a logically complex app that modelled a [bowling scorecard](https://github.com/bateso88/bowling-challenge) just 5 days after first coming across JavaScript. -->

#### Mathematical Ability

I have always found mathematics comes easily to me. My greatest achievement was winning a medal in the Maclaurin round of the Intermediate Mathematical Olympiad, as one of the top 100 candidates in the country. 

I have found my proficiency in maths is incredibly helpful when programming more complex logic. 

#### Teamwork 

I have a good amount of experience at working in a team. My final projects at university, my time in insurance and my time at Makers all required me to develop my teamworking skills. 

During my time in insurance I often prepared reports without being instructed. I would share my findings with the team and shed light on previously undiscovered issues. This work often hugely benefitted the team. 

At Makers I found I found myself just as comfortable listening to others as I was taking the lead and providing a clear direction for the team. I learnt the importance of frequent stand-ups and retros and the essentiality of clear communication.
 

<!-- #### Teamwork (MAYBE REPLACE WITH PROBLEM SOLVING??)

(((((NEEDS AN EXAMPLE)))))
From my final group projects at university to my time working in insurance, I have always found myself well-adjusted to working in a team. I am equally happy listening to other members' ideas and trying to get my point across, so long as the team succeeds. I am willing to take initiative and do extra work if I know it will benefit the team. -->

## Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **[Guilt trip / Sloth](https://github.com/bateso88/Guilt_Trip)**            | A phone app that gamifies the pedometer to encourage users to reach a step-count target. I played an integral part in getting the app to display the phone's step count and linked the app to local phone storage to ensure data persisted. I had a considerable role in much of the app's logic and the app's design/layout solution. In two weeks I learnt how to use React Native and create a phone app. | React Native, JavaScript, Expo, Jest, Express |
| **[Spacebook](https://github.com/bateso88/acebook-sholk)**  | A webapp clone of Facebook (see [here](https://limitless-fortress-82053.herokuapp.com/)). I was responsible for setting up the CI/CD and most of the front-end styling. I played a major role in making the 'like' button update asynchronously and many other areas of complex logic. Creating this app taught me how to expand on the shell of a basic Rails project. | Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Capybara, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Travis, Heroku               |
| **[Bank account](https://github.com/bateso88/bank-tech-test)** | A simple solo project that models a bank account. This project demonstrates OOP, the SRP, DDD, dependency injection, thorough testing and clean, legible, tidy code.  | Ruby, RSpec          |
| **[Hatch](https://github.com/bateso88/Hatch)** _(In Progress)_ | A web app for a budding [property company](https://hatch-retail.space/) that connects small, independent retailers with high street landlords. I took on this project to simultaneously help an exciting new company get free access to a relatively complex web app, and to improve my knowledge of Rails, CI/CD and AWS and cloud architecture. The app is deployed on [Heroku](https://stormy-brushlands-49881.herokuapp.com/) but I am currently teaching myself about AWS and ultimately the web app will go into production there. | Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Capybara, JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, Travis, Heroku, AWS             |
