## About me 

I am junior developer who has recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech). I found the three months there challenging, exciting and immensely rewarding. I am now looking for a role that allows me to further expand my learning through complex problem-solving and continued exposure to new technologies. 

Previously I worked in insurance, in the Lloyd's of London market for 4 years after studying Engineering Mathematics at Bristol University.

<!-- After graduating from Bristol University with a degree in Engineering Mathematics, I spent four years working in insurance as an underwriter in the Lloyd's of London market. The marketplace is well-known for its antiquated technologies and it was there that I really learned of the importance of good tech. 

Automation was an essential skill I taught myself in order to improve accuracies in large amounts of data and save time otherwise spent on needless manual tasks. The satisfaction of seeing the vast improvements that my influence had on my team's work led me to consider a career change. I investigated the growing Insurtech industry and attended several conferences and lectures. I came to the conclusion that I would like to be a part of the tech industry to help modernise and improve other industries.

For the first 3 months of 2021 I was a student at Makers Academy. Here I became fully certain that I'd made the right decision to change career. The three months were challenging, exciting and immensely rewarding. I am now looking for a role that allows me to further expand my learning as much as possible with complex problem-solving and continued exposure to new technologies.  -->

## Skills


#### Attention to Detail

In my time in insurance, consolidating large amounts of data came naturally. I would check the accuracy of thousands of payments and proof-read vast spreadsheets. My proudest moment was when I identified a £700,000 shortfall that various managers had previously missed, saving the company that amount. This skill is one that I have found extremely useful in learning to code, particularly in rapidly debugging issues.     

#### Self-led Learner

With no experience in DIY, I taught myself how to convert a van into a comfortable, tiny home with solar-powered electical and water systems, in just 2 months.

 ((((SOMETHING ABOUT TEACHING MYSELF AUTOMATION IN INSURANCE)))) 
 
 During my time at makers I was able to learn new concepts, frameworks and languages quickly and produce high-quality code shortly thereafter. I produced a logically complex app that modelled a [bowling scorecard](https://github.com/bateso88/bowling-challenge) just 5 days after first coming across JavaScript. For my final project (see 'Sloth' below), I learned React Native and produced a high-quality phone app in just two weeks. 

#### Mathematical Ability

I have always found mathematics comes easily to me. My greatest achievement was winning a medal in the Maclaurin round of the Intermediate Mathematical Olympiad, as one of the top 100 candidates in the country. 

#### Teamwork 

(((((NEEDS AN EXAMPLE)))))
From my final group projects at university to my time working in insurance, I have always found myself well-adjusted to working in a team. I am equally happy listening to other members' ideas and trying to get my point across, so long as the team succeeds. I am willing to take initiative and do extra work if I know it will benefit the team.

## Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **[Guilt trip / Sloth](https://github.com/bateso88/Guilt_Trip)**            | A phone app that gamifies the pedometer to encourage users to reach a step-count target. I played an integral part in getting the app to display the phone's step count and linking the app to local phone storage to ensure data persisted each time a user opens the app. I had a considerable role in much of the app's logic and the app's design layout solution. | React Native, JavaScript, Expo, Jest |
| **[Spacebook](https://github.com/bateso88/acebook-sholk)**  | A webapp clone of Facebook (deployed [here](https://fierce-plains-18412.herokuapp.com/)). I was responsible for setting up the CI/CD and most of the front-end styling. I played a major role in making the 'like' button update asynchronously and many other areas of complex logic. | Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Capybara, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Travis, Heroku               |
| **[Bank account](https://github.com/bateso88/bank-tech-test)** | A simple solo project that models a bank account. | Ruby, RSpec          |
